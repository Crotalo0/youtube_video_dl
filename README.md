# youtube_video_dl
Youtube video dl written in python
NEED FFMPEG-PYTHON and PYTUBE LIBRARY

Linux version should work also on win, the differences are in paths.
It is possible to download audio and video separately.
ALways higher res will be chosen for now.
Usage:
Insert video url, set save path (where to save everything), get video info and the nstart download.
Merging audio and video with ffmpeg is slow, dont quit the program even apparently seems not responsive.
